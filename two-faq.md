# Textual Entailment Game

Thanks for doing our HITs! With your help, we think we'll be able to build some pretty exciting technologies to help computers better understand human language.

### What do you mean by creative?
We do not have a strict definition of creative. Clever and interesting claims are considered creative.

### What do you mean by "non-trivial kinds of inference"?
A claim that requires non-trivial infernece could be soemthing that requires a few steps of reasoning to come to the correct label.

### When is a claim "Invalid"?
If the claim does not fit the label or if is completely unrelated to the prompt, it is considered invalid.

### How do I rank a claim if it is "Invalid"?
If one of 2 claims is invalid, rank it lower. If both are invalid, still do try to rank the sentences according to creativity.

### When do I get the bonuses?
Adding bonuses isn't automatic so we will add bonuses when we approve the HITs. So you'll have the bonuses 1-2 days after all HITs are completed. 

### What are you using this data for?
We will be using this data to test AI models. These models have managed to mostly solve existing datasets of this type and so with your help, we're hoping to make a dataset that's too difficult for these models to solve easily.

### Who are you?
We are busy graduate students with the Bowman Group, a subgroup of the ML<sup>2</sup> group at New York University Center for Data Science. We are also affiliated with the NYU Departments of Computer Science, and Linguistics.
